      Today Alex Chen came over again!! We went to The Bent Spoon and got some wacky flavors. We were talking a lot about dogs and kids and parents and grandparents and telling each other all these real and made up stories about familial love.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was saying how Father Dan at Columbia Catholic Ministry told this story about how he used to be a security guard at a retirement home and this man would come really early in the morning and leave really late at night and he eventually stopped coming. 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he said something that was like "the thing that amazes me about old people is that they used to be young."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was telling me this story that's like probably some tale about this couple where the man gave the woman peanuts and said I wish these were emeralds and then when they were old he gave her emeralds and said I wish these were peanuts like saying he wishes they were young again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway we exchanged lots of stories and thoughts and then we had to part ways because his mom stays up for him until he gets home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, I videochatted with Alex House until he fell asleep.
